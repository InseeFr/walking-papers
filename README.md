# Orchestrateur de saisie papier

This orchestrator is based on [Lunatic](https://github.com/InseeFr/Lunatic).

It is used to manually input data in Lunatic surveys, without any control or filter, to input respondent's answers as it is.

To use it, run `pnpm && pnpm start`.

You can change the `source.json` in `src/` to manually change the questionnaire. (Note: this is an alpha, it will be possible to import your source dynamically in a future version.)
